# Boredifier™

## A Formalization Engine for Casual Human Expression

### Executive Summary

Boredifier™ is a non-AI, deterministic linguistic transformation utility designed to algorithmically convert informal textual statements into verbose, impersonal, and stylistically monotonous prose. It is intended for individuals, organizations, and agencies requiring the obfuscation or sterilization of casual language into forms more suitable for bureaucratic documentation, soulless corporate reports, or joyless academic memos.

### Functional Specifications

* **Input Modality:** Casual, expressive English sentences.
* **Output Modality:** Passive, excessively formal, and meaning-preserving variants.
* **Transformation Methodology:** Rule-based pipeline employing modular detection and replacement systems.

### System Architecture Overview

The transformation pipeline consists of the following sequential modules:

* **Subject Identifier**
  * Extracts agent noun phrases (e.g., “I”, “she”, “we”).
  * Normalizes to impersonal categorical labels (e.g., “Third-party activity”).
* **Action Transformer**
  * Maps energetic or emotive verbs (e.g., “ate”, “studied”, “chilled”) to neutral formal descriptions (e.g., “nutritional intake occurred”, “cognitive exertion occurred”).
* **Time Descriptor**
  * Identifies temporal markers including clock times and expressions (e.g., “at 3AM”, “all night”).
  * Converts to abstract representations (e.g., “during early morning hours”).
* **Location Normalizer**
  * Detects place references (e.g., “my cousin’s house”, “at the park”).
  * Generalizes to institutional or environmental terms (e.g., “within a familial residence”).
* **Causal Justifier**
  * Parses causal phrases (e.g., “because I was tired”).
  * Transforms into formal rationale structures (e.g., “due to fatigue”).
* **Sentence Assembler**
  * Concatenates all formalized segments into a syntactically coherent final output.

### Sample Transformation

**Input:**

“I ate a giant pizza at 3 AM after watching anime.”

**Output:**

“Personal action: Nutritional intake occurred during early morning hours following media consumption.”

### Installation & Execution Protocol
